# NextPen üñãÔ∏è

This repository is a full-featured Next.js application that allows users to browse, view, and edit articles. The app is built with modern Next.js 15 features, including the **App Router**, server-side rendering, dynamic routes, and authentication using **NextAuth.js**.

---

## Features
- **Dynamic Routing**: Articles are fetched and rendered dynamically based on the `slug`.
- **Authentication**: Integration with NextAuth.js to protect editing and other actions.
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Metadata is dynamically generated for SEO.
- **Article Management**: Fetch, view, and edit articles via REST API endpoints.
- **Client and Server Components**: Uses the App Router with hybrid rendering capabilities.

### Editing Articles
1. Log in using your GitHub account or another OAuth provider configured in the environment variables.

## API Endpoints

1. **Fetch an Article**  
   `GET /api/articles/:slug`  
   Returns the article content for the given `slug`.

2. **Save an Article**  
   `POST /api/articles/:slug`  
   Updates the article content for the given `slug`.
